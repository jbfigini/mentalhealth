# mentalhealth
Technology has enhanced our daily lives, and it has changed how we commute, how we interact, how we access various services and so on. 
However, the technology world is known for long working hours, tight deadlines, and competitive environments. 
While we enjoy the convenience of new technologies, we should also pay attention to the employees' mental health behind these technologies. 
So I would like to explore this mental health survey (2014) to learn about the mental status of these tech employees, showing some metrics using R Shiny.
